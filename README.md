# Design-Patterens
----------------------------------
Design patterns are standardized best practices that the software engineering community has identified for solving common problems when designing software or applications.

# Types of Design Patterns:
----------------------------------
There are three main types of design patterens
*Creational
*Structural
*Behavioral
  # Creational:
    Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
  # Structural:
    Structural design patterns deal with how you composes classes to form larger structures. They donâ€™t deal with the functionality of those classes. This makes them an excellent tool for creating extensible and 
    reusable code.
  # Behavioral:
     Design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.
     Behavioral Design Patterns deal with the communication or interaction between Classes and Objects. The interaction between the objects should be so that they talk to each other and are still loosely coupled. 
     Loose coupling is the key to implementing the n-tier architecture.
