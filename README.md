# Design-Patterens
----------------------------------
Design patterns are standardized best practices that the software engineering community has identified for solving common problems when designing software or applications.

# Types of Design Patterns:
----------------------------------
There are three main types of design patterens
*Creational
*Structural
*Behavioral
  # Creational:
    Creational Design Patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects that suit a given situation. In simple 
    words, we can say that the Creational Design Pattern deals with Object Creation and Initialization. This Design Pattern gives the programmer more flexibility 
    in deciding which objects need to be created for a given situation.
  # Structural:
    Structural design patterns deal with how you composes classes to form larger structures. They donâ€™t deal with the functionality of those classes. This makes them     an excellent tool for creating extensible and reusable code.
  # Behavioral:
     Design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in     
     carrying out this communication.
     Behavioral Design Patterns deal with the communication or interaction between Classes and Objects. The interaction between the objects should be so that they 
     talk to each other and are still loosely coupled. Loose coupling is the key to implementing the n-tier architecture.
